                <h2>About Me!</h2>
                <img src="" alt="">
                <p>My name is Rylan Stump, I'm currently a ninth grader at York Tech and taking IT as my Technical shop.
                    I've
                    always had an interest in computers and how they function, so far the most interesting courses I've
                    taken are Networking and Computer Programming, both of which I really am passionate in. I am highly
                    considering taking Networking and Cybersecurity for my Junior and Senior year, as I seem to have a
                    calling in cyber defense, I'm in Cyber Patriot, which has made my love for Cybersecurity a lot
                    better and a bigger understanding on how defense works for multiple different operating systems such
                    as Linux systems and cisco.</p>

                <p>Programming is also a big consideration I have in mind for my Junior and Senior year here at York
                    Tech, as I have a new interest in making websites and want to learn more about making applications
                    and software development. The teacher, Mr. Smith is also very straight forward as he pushes kids to
                    their full potential and has a real passion in the Computer Programming world, he understands the
                    students and loves gaming as much as we do. When I leave York Tech, I plan to go to college to get
                    my Bachelor's degree in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity or Software Development.</p>

                <h2>My hobbies!</h2>
                <h3>Drawing</h3>
                <p>I love to draw fictional characters, stuff like Pokemon, anime, comic strips, and horror characters.
                    Ever since I was little, I had a connection to art and expressing myself through the drawings I put
                    out on paper. I mostly produce drawings of horror characters, both of which I see in movies and ones
                    that create in my head.</p>
                <h3 style="display: block;">Pokemon/Yu-Gi-Oh card collecting</h3>

                <p>Ever since I was 13, I started collecting Pokemon cards and playing the games, I collect cards from
                    all decades and I have a rare 1st edition Dragonite and a Dark Charizard, I have about 3 binders
                    full of the cards. I also found an interest in Yu-Gi-Oh, I started playing the game with my friends
                    and my dad.</p>

                <h3>Vintage Camera Collecting and photography</h3>
                <p>I started collecting cameras around the same time as I started collecting Pokemon cards. I've always
                    loved the history of cameras and how they've evolved to be just a feature on our phones, by just
                    using an application. I've taken photography as a hobby just recently, after a visit from Florida in
                    March of last year, I took some amazing pictures.</p>
